# Windows 11 Debloater

This script is based of my Windows 10's debloater script. You can find it [here!](https://github.com/teeotsa/windows-10-debloat)

# Can you run it?

Well, depends. Some beta builds might work but you have to remove requirement from the script! I made this script using Windows 11 build 22000
